\description{
This volatility strategy (which is the same as a long straddle with the put replaced by a synthetic put) amounts to shorting stock and buying two ATM (or the nearest ITM call options with a strike price X. The traderâ€™s outlook is neutral. This is a capital gain strategy (assuming S0 is greater than or equal to X and V0 is greater than (S0 minus X)) (Kakushadze & Serur, 2018).
}
\details{
According to conceptual details given by Cohen (2015), and a closed form solution provided by Kakushadze and Serur (2018), this method is developed, and the given examples are created, to compute per share Profit and Loss at expiration for Long Call Synthetic Straddle Option Strategy and draw its graph in the plots tab.
